            <p>

            <p>
              Datagrid allows you to voluntarily provide us with contact information through our website and when you are purchasing or redeeming offers or registering products you purchased from other authorized retailers. The information we may collect from you includes your name, email address, phone number, and past purchases. We do not collect or store credit card information. In addition, if you contact us, we may keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. Finally, we may receive contact details or other information about you from publicly and commercially available sources, which we may combine with other information we receive from or about you. We will use the information we collect from third party sources in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

              If you have requested information or if you have purchased products or services from us in the past, we may use this information to provide you with news, offers for upgrades, discounts and other marketing information.

We use industry standard measures, including administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, to help protect personal data from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be entirely secure. As a result, while we always use all reasonable efforts to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your information and the submission of data is thus at your own risk.

            <p>
              Datagrid, Inc. is an entity which is based in the United States of America and many of our service providers are based outside of the European Economic Area (EEA). This means that your personal data will be transferred outside of the EEA.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
            </p>

              <li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.</li>
              <li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.</li>
              <li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.</li>

            <p className="mt-4">

            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

            <p>
              Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. We have explained your rights below; if you wish to exercise any of your rights, please contact us at contact@datagrid.com.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">You have the right to:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-3 space-y-3">
              <li>Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a &ldquo;data subject access request&rdquo;). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
              <li>Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li>
              <li>Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li>
              <li>Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</li>
              <li>Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data&apos;s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
              <li>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
              <li>Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you do not want to receive promotional or other e-mail from Datagrid, you can remove yourself from our mailing lists.</li>

For purposes of this section, &ldquo;Personal Information&rdquo; has the meaning given in the CCPA but does not include information exempted from the scope of the CCPA or information we collect from you in the course of providing services to you or receiving services from you where you are an employee, controlling owner, director, officer or contractor of a company, partnership, sole proprietorship, non-profit or government agency. In some cases, we may provide a different privacy notice to certain categories of California residents, such as job applicants, in which case that notice will apply instead of this section.

              <li><strong>Deletion.</strong> You can ask us to delete the Personal Information that we have collected from you.</li>
              <li><strong>Opt-out of sales.</strong> If we sell your Personal Information, you can opt-out. In addition, if you direct us not to sell your Personal Information, we will consider it a request pursuant to California&apos;s &ldquo;Shine the Light&rdquo; law to stop sharing your personal information covered by that law with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.</li>
              <li><strong>Opt-in.</strong> If we know that you are younger than 16 years old, we will ask for your permission (or if you are younger than 13 years old, your parent&apos;s or guardian&apos;s permission) to sell your Personal Information before we do so.</li>
              <li><strong>Nondiscrimination.</strong> You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination in the form of legally prohibited increases in the price or decreases in the quality of our Service.</li>

              <strong>How to exercise your rights.</strong> You may exercise your California privacy rights described above as follows:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-3 space-y-1">
              <li><strong>Right to information, access and deletion.</strong> You may exercise your right to information, access or deletion by contacting us at contact@datagrid.com.</li>
              <li><strong>Right to opt-out of the &ldquo;sale&rdquo; of your Personal Information.</strong> Like many companies, we use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you. Our use of some of these services may be classified under California law as a &ldquo;sale&rdquo; of your Personal Information to the companies that provide the services because they collect information from our users (e.g., device data and online activity data) to help them serve ads more likely to interest you.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-4">
              We reserve the right to confirm your California residency to process your requests and will need to confirm your identity to process your requests to exercise these rights. Government identification may be required. You may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. In order to designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, you must provide a valid power of attorney, the requester&apos;s valid government-issued identification, and the authorized agent&apos;s valid government issued identification. We cannot process your request if you do not provide us with sufficient detail to allow us to understand and respond to it.
